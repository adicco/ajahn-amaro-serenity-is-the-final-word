#### Verses on Serene Reflection
##### by Master Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091-1157)
*translator unknown*

In silence and serenity one forgets all words  
Clearly and vividly THAT appears before one  
When one realizes it it is vast and without edges  
In its essence one is clearly aware  
Singularly reflecting is this bright awareness  
Full of wonder is this pure reflection  
Dew and the moon  
Stars and streams  
Snow on pine trees  
And clouds on mountain peaks  
From darkness they glow brightly  
From obscurity they all turn to resplendent light  
Infinite wonder permeates this serenity  
In this reflection all intentional efforts vanish  
Serenity is the final word of all teachings  
Reflection is the response to all manifestations  
Devoid of any effort this response  
Is natural and spontaneous  
Disharmony will arise  
If in reflection there is no serenity  
All will become wasteful and secondary  
If in serenity there is no reflection  
The Truth of serene reflection is perfect and complete  
The hundred rivers flow  
In tumbling torrents  
To the great ocean
